# Giggie

## This app lists jobs/gigs as objects that can be interacted with. Users can both create tasks that they need done as "gigs", and accept those gigs as workers. Gigs can be edited, commented on, deleted, and cancelled by workers who decide not to pursue them anymore.

## You can test it out for yourself [here](https://giggie.herokuapp.com/)!

## Use the dummy login "dummyuser@test.com" and password "password" to login without registering, and start creating and messing around with goals to your heart's content.
