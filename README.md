# Goal-And-Get-It

### (Note: this is not the repository from which the final app is deployed, this is my personal repository that carries a complete copy of that app. The actual repository is a collaboration between me and two others, and can be found [here](https://github.com/NPH82/Goal-and-Get-It))

## This is a simple goal tracking application that accepts user input and persists data passed in using a MySQL database.

## You can test it out for yourself [here](https://goal-and-get-it.herokuapp.com/)!

## Use the dummy login "dummyuser@test.com" and password "password" to login without registering, and start creating and messing around with goals to your heart's content.
